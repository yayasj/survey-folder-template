ODK Group Headers Solution Summary
==================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The issue you reported - "observations appearing in the wrong column" and "unnamed columns at the edge of the data" - 
is caused by ODK Central's default CSV export behavior which includes group prefixes in column headers.

For example:
- Instead of "instanceID", you get "meta/instanceID"  
- Instead of "submission_date", you get "__system/submissionDate"
- Group structures create nested column names that cause misalignment

ROOT CAUSE:
The previous approach was trying to fix this client-side with complex column detection logic. However, 
ODK Central provides a built-in solution through its CSV export API parameters.

PROPER SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Use ODK Central's CSV export API directly with `groupPaths=false` parameter
2. This tells ODK Central to flatten group headers during export
3. No more "meta/" or "__system/" prefixes - just clean column names
4. Eliminates the column misalignment problem at the source

NEW BEHAVIOR:
- Primary method: ODK Central CSV API with group flattening
- Fallback 1: OData method with manual processing (previous approach)  
- Fallback 2: List submissions method (final fallback)
- Each method logged for transparency

CONFIGURATION UPDATES:
- Removed: clean_edge_columns, edge_column_threshold
- Added: flatten_group_headers (default: true)
- Simplified approach focuses on using the right ODK API

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Clean column headers without group prefixes
- Proper data alignment in columns
- Fewer unnamed/problematic columns at data edges
- Better performance (less client-side processing)

TEST THIS SOLUTION:
Run: python -m survey_pipeline.cli ingest --dry-run

You should see log messages indicating:
"Using ODK Central CSV export API for [form_id] with group flattening enabled"

This addresses the core issue you reported with observations appearing in wrong columns
and unnamed columns at data edges.
